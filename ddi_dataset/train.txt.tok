Milk, milk products, and drug-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of drug.
The concurrent administration of drug and drug increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving drug alone.
It is not known whether this potentiation of drug rashes is due to drug or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.
In controlled clinical trials of drug, 22 patients received concomitant drug and drug.
However, this sample size is too small to allow for any conclusions to be drawn regarding the risk of rashes with concomitant drug and drug use.
In common with other drug, drug may reduce the efficacy of oral drug
Interaction with drug other than drug has not been specifically studied;
however, no deleterious interactions were seen when drug was administered after drug, inhalational drug, drug and muscle relaxant antagonists administered in conjunction with sedation or anesthesia.
Particular caution is necessary when using drug in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) of other drugs taken in overdose (especially drug) may emerge with the reversal of the drug effect by drug.
Although drug exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a drug agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients.
drug blocks the central effects of drug by competitive interaction at the receptor level.
The effects of nonbenzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as drug, triazolopyridazines and others, are also blocked by drug.
The pharmacokinetics of drug are unaltered in the presence of drug and vice versa.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug.
Use in Ambulatory Patients The effects of drug may wear off before a drug is completely cleared from the body.
An adequate period of observation must be provided for any patient in whom either drug (such as drug) or large doses of drug (such as  10 mg of drug) have been used.
Because of the increased risk of adverse reactions in patients who have been taking drug on a regular basis, it is particularly important that physicians query patients or their guardians carefully about drug, drug and drug use as part of the history prior to any procedure in which the use of drug is planned.
Caution is advised when drug is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain drug or drug) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as drug or drug).
In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) a nd female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, drug 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with drug 500 mg every 8 hours or drug 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days.
In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, drug at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with drug 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with drug 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23 day pretreatment period with drug (n=18) or with drug 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers.
Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0-24 hrs) of drug and drug were observed , there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of drug, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.
Table 1 Changes in drug and drug Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers
drug drug
drug dosed as a 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneous injection q12h for four doses did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug or the level of platelet aggregation in healthy adults.
drug or drug (drug and related drugs, drug and drug) enhanced hypokalemia.
drug enhanced possibility of arrhythmias or drug toxicity associated with hypokalemia.
drug (oral agents and drug) diminished antidiabetic effect.
Rarely drug toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue drug after concurrent high-dose drug therapy.
Monitor drug levels or the therapeutic effect for which drug is given;
drug, drug, or drug increased metabolic clearance of drug because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
Observe the patient for possible diminished effect of drug and increase the drug dosage accordingly.
drug (particularly C-17 alkylated drug such as drug, drug, drug, and similar compounds) enhanced tendency toward edema.
When drug therapy is initiated, a reduction in drug dosage may be required, and increased amounts may be required when drug is terminated.
drug or other drug (concurrent use with drug may result in uterine hypertonus, possibly causing uterine rupture or cervical laceration, especially in the absence of adequate cervical dilatation;
drug: A report of severe drug toxicity was reported in a patient receiving drug.
It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between drug and drug and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed.
Furthermore it has been proposed that drug resulted In induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested drug being converted to the toxic metabolites.
drug: drug is known to slow the metabolism of drug and increase its serum levels drug levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with drug, signs and symptoms of drug toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the drug should be made.
drug: Potential interaction of drug and drug may exist.
drug: drug may increase serum levels of drug.
To avoid drug intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the drug should be made.
Therophylline: A recent study has shown that concomitan administration of drug and drug may cause elevated plasma levels of drug, and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of drug.
Since the therapeutic range of drug is narrow drug serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of drug should be made.
drug: A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of drug when co administered with drug.
Plasma drug concentration should be monitored when drug and drug are co administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of drug should be made.
Co-administration of drug and drug or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., drug) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the drug may be potentiated.
drug, Including Oral, Injectable, Transdermal, and Implantable drug: An interaction study demonstrated that co-administration of drug and the oral drug drug produced average decreases of drug and drug levels of 14% and 31%, respectively.
Therefore, drug, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms, may not be reliable when drug is co-administered.
Specific interaction studies have demonstrated the following: drug: During the first day of concomitant administration, trough concentrations of drug were increased by about 30-fold.
Steady-state drug plasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than in the absence of drug.
The concomitant administration of drug and drug is contraindicated.
Co-administration of drug decreased the plasma concentrations of drug (a CYP3A4 substrate) by approximately 50%.
drug: Co-administration of drug and drug has not been studied in man.
Co-administration of drug and drug resulted in markedly increased plasma concentrations of drug in animals.
Caution should be exercised if drug and drug are used together.
drug: An increased risk of elevated liver aminotransferases was observed in patients receiving concomitant therapy with drug.
Therefore, the concomitant administration of drug and drug is contraindicated, and alternative drug should be considered.
Co-administration of drug decreased the plasma concentrations of drug by approximately 40%.
drug is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other oral drug that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2C9 or CYP3A4.
drug: Co-administration of drug 125 mg b.i.d. and drug, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the plasma concentrations of drug by approximately 2-fold.
No dose adjustment of drug is necessary, but increased effects of drug should be considered.
drug and Other drug: Co-administration of drug decreased the plasma concentrations of drug (a CYP3A4 substrate), and its active  -hydroxy acid metabolite, by approximately 50%.
drug is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other drug that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as drug and drug.
Patients using CYP3A4 metabolized drug should have cholesterol levels monitored after drug is initiated to see whether the drug dose needs adjustment.
drug: Co-administration of drug 500 mg b.i.d. for 6 days decreased the plasma concentrations of both drug (a CYP2C9 substrate) and drug (a CYP3A4 substrate) by 29 and 38%, respectively.
Clinical experience with concomitant administration of drug and drug in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension did not show clinically relevant changes in INR or drug dose (baseline vs. end of the clinical studies), and the need to change the drug dose during the trials due to changes in INR or due to adverse events was similar among drug- and placebo-treated patients.
drug, drug and drug: drug has no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with drug and drug, and drug has no significant effect on plasma levels of drug.
Few systemic data have been collected on the metabolism of drug following concomitant administration with other drugs or, alternatively, the effect of concomitant administration of drug on the metabolism of other drugs.
In vitro studies indicate that drug is primarily metabolized to drug by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme.
Therefore, the potential exists for a drug interaction between drug and drugs that affect the CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., drug and drug).
The drug metabolite of drug does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.
The effects of concomitant administration of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers.
Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of drug, the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug were unaffected.
However, there were 16% and 32% increases in the AUC and Cmax, respectively, of the combined moieties of drug and drug.
While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of drug (e.g., drug, drug, drug).
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450IID6 (CYP2D6): Many drugs, including most drug (SSRIs, many drug), drug, drug, and drug are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme.
Although drug is not metabolized by this isoenzyme, drug and drug are inhibitors of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme in vitro.
In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of drug given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg drug increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of drug by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.
Therefore, co-administration of drug with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain drug (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug), drug (e.g., drug, drug, drug), drug (e.g., drug), and drug (e.g., drug, drug), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
drug: Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of drug is enhanced by the drug drug .
drug and drug: Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving drug concurrently with either drug or drug.
Administration of drug Tablets to patients receiving either drug or drug concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of drug and agents (e.g., drug, other drug, drug, systemic drug, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
drug: In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced drug tolerance in patients who were drinking drug during treatment with drug.
The consumption of drug during treatment with drug should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that drug, drug, drug, and drug did not influence drug clearance.
The majority of patients in RA clinical studies received one or more of the following concomitant medications with drug: drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Concurrent administration of a drug with drug has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and no significant additional efficacy over use of the drug alone.
Concurrent therapy with drug and drug is not recommended.
There is insufficient experience to assess the safety and efficacy of drug administered concurrently with drug, and therefore such use is not recommended.
drug and drug Administration of drug or drug in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of drug) concentration .
In a small (n=30) combination study of drug with drug, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients.
drug: In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50% in the free fraction of drug and drug at concentrations in the clinical range.
drug: In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50% in the free fraction of drug at concentrations in the clinical range.
drug: Following concomitant administration of a single dose of drug to subjects receiving multiple doses of drug, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when drug was given alone.
Because of the potential for drug levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both drug and drug.
drug: Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when drug and drug were co-administered has been rarely reported.
Animal studies indicate that drug may be ineffective if the patient has recently received a drug.
Preliminary studies indicate that the concomitant use of drug and drug results in a higher cardiac output and, usually, a lower pulmonary wedge pressure than when either drug is used alone.
There was no evidence of drug interactions in clinical studies in which drug was administered concurrently with other drugs, including drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Drug Interactions: a. Drugs Enhancing drug Effect: Oral drug: drug may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time.
Therefore, when drug is given with drug or drug, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
drug: Drugs such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving drug.
The anticoagulant effect of drug is enhanced by concurrent treatment with drug (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency.
Thus in order to avoid bleeding, reduced dosage of drug is recommended during treatment with drug (human).
Drugs Decreasing drug Effect: drug, drug, drug, or drug may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of drug.
drug Injection should not be mixed with drug, drug, drug, or drug, since it has been reported that these drugs are incompatible with drug and a precipitate may form.
Steady-state serum concentrations of drug are reported to fluctuate significantly when drug is either added or deleted from the drug regimen.
Serious anticholinergic symptoms (severe dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of drug when drug is added to the drug regimen.
In addition, higher-than expected steady-state serum concentrations of drug have been observed when therapy is initiated in patients already taking drug.
In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with drug, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of drug may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.
The therapeutic efficacy of drug may be compromised in these patients when drug is discontinued.
There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other drug, including drug, when drug has been administered in combination with these agents.
drug and its active metabolite, norfluoxe-tine, have long half-lives (4 to 16 days for drug), that may affect strategies during conversion from one drug to the other.
Administration of drug during therapy with a drug has been shown to produce a  stimulating  effect in some depressed patients.
Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required when drug is used with other drug or drug.
Such individuals are referred to as  poor metabolizers  of drugs such as drug, drug, and the drug.
In addition, certain drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme, including many drug (drug, drug, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isoenzyme, and thus may make normal metab-olizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system, leading to drug interactions.
Concomitant use of drug with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug or the other drug.
Therefore, co-administration of drug with other drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme, including other drug, drug, drug, and drug (eg, drug, drug, and drug), or that inhibit this enzyme (eg, drug), should be approached with caution.
Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drug, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with drug (drug, drug, drug, drug, or drug) should be considered.
Caution in using concomitant drugs such as drug (ophthalmic and systemic), drug and/or drug is advised.
drug have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic drug.It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with drug in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect.
Oral drug CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN drug ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH drug.
drug: The combined use of drug and drug should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination.
drug: Since drug may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take drug at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a drug to avoid impeding its absorption.
drug: Because drug can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of drug including drug, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.
The benefits and risks of using drug with drug and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed
Drug-drug interactions In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that drug and drug are not inhibitors of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2.
Therefore, drug should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a drug to avoid impeding its absorption .
Concomitant administration of drug (equivalent to 145mg drug) with drug (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for drug by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3 -hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults.
A single dose of drug had no clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug.
Concomitant administration of drug (equivalent to 145 mg drug) with drug (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in drug AUC values in 22 healthy males.
The drug Cmax values were not significantly affected by drug.
The pharmacokinetics of drug were not significantly affected by drug
The daily dose of drug should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug and nefazadone) .
Caution should be taken when drug is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as drug, drug and drug (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
The concomitant use of drug with other drug may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
Concurrent administration of drug and drug may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.drug, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased drugs half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
Data from a randomized trial of drug and drug plus or minus drug in ovarian cancer indicated that drug significantly reduced neurotoxicity;
however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that drug should not be administered with drug and/or drug.1
Special consideration should be given to the administration of drug in patients receiving drug or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
In evaluating the potential for interactions among co-administered antiepilepsy drugs (drug), whether or not an drug induces or does not induce metabolic enzymes is an important consideration.
drug, drug and drug are ge nerally classified as enzyme inducers;
drug and drug are not.
drug is considered to be a non-enzyme inducing drug.
Effects of drug on other Antiepilepsy Drugs (drug) : drug: drug had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of drug in patients with epilepsy.
drug: drug had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of drug or its epoxide metabolite in patients with epilepsy.
drug: drug causes a slight decrease (about 10%) in steady-state drug concentrations.
drug or drug : No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been performed examining the addition of drug to regimens containing drug or drug.
The addition of drug in a limited number of patients in three well-controlled studies caused no systematic changes in drug or drug concentrations when compared to placebo.
Effects of other Antiepilepsy Drugs (drug) on drug : drug: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug clearance is 60% greater in patients taking drug with or without other enzyme- inducing drug.
drug: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug clearance is 60% greater in patients taking drug with or without other enzyme- inducing drug.
drug (drug): Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug clearance is 60% greater in patients taking drug (drug) with or without other enzyme-inducing drug.
drug: The addition of drug to patients taking drug chronically had no effect on drug pharmacokinetics, but drug significantly decreased drug binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration.
Interaction of drug with Other Drugs : drug : Co-administration of drug (800 mg/day) to patients taking drug chronically had no effect on drug pharmacokinetics.
drug: A single 10 mg dose of drug did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug at steady state.
drug: No significant differences were observed in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug or drug with the addition of drug given as a single dose.
drug: Concomitant administration of drug did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug or the mean daily trough serum level of drug.
drug or drug: No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of drug (0.125 mg) and drug (10 mg) when given together as a single dose.
The pharmacokinetics of drug were not affected by multiple-dose administration of drug.
drug has shown no clinically important potentiation of the pharmacodynamic effects of triazo lam or drug.
Because of the possible additive effects of drugs that may depress the nervous system, drug or drug should be used cautiously in combination with drug.
Oral drug: Multiple dose administration of drug (8 mg/day monotherapy) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of oral drug in healthy women of childbearing age.
drug : drug pharmacokinetics were not significantly different before and after drug multiple-dose regimens.
This indicates that drug does not cause induction or inhibition of the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems responsible for the metabolism of drug.
Interaction of drug with Highly Protein Bound Drugs: In vitro data showed that drug is 96% bound to human plasma protein and therefore has the potential to interact with other highly protein bound compounds.
drug may interact with any of the following: - drug (e.g., drug) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
- drug (e.g., drug) or

Elevated plasma levels of drug have been reported with concomitant use of some drug.
There have been reports of drug-related side-effects in patients on concomitant drug-drug therapy.
Therefore, monitoring of drug plasma levels should be considered and dosage of drug adjusted as required.
drug have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of drug.
Although this interaction has not been reported with drug, caution should be exercised when drug is given concomitantly with drug-containing products.
drug or drug substantially interfere with the absorption of some drug, resulting in low urine levels.
Also, concomitant administration of drug with products containing drug, drug containing drug, or drug (drug) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
drug, including drug, may enhance the effects of oral drug, such as drug or its derivatives.
Seizures have been reported in patients taking another drug and the drug drug concurrently.
Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when drug and certain drug are administered concomitantly.
Elevated drug serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of drug and drug.
drug, drug, Metal Cations, drug drug form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations.
Administration of drug with drug containing drug, drug, or drug, with drug, with metal cations such as drug, or with drug containing drug or drug, or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as drug (drug) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug, resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired.
drug drug drug, like other drug, may inhibit the metabolism of drug and drug.
In some patients, this may lead to reduced clearance, prolongation of plasma half-life, and enhanced effects of drug and drug.
drug: drug is a competitive inhibitor of the metabolism of drug.
Serum drug concentrations increase when drug is initiated in a patient maintained on drug.
When initiating a multi-day course of drug in a patient maintained on drug, the drug maintenance dose should be halved for the period of concurrent use of drug and monitoring of serum drug concentrations should be initiated as a guide to further dosage adjustments.
drug: In subjects receiving drug, no significant change in clotting time was observed when drug was coadministered.
However, because some drug have been reported to enhance the effects of drug or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a drug is administered with drug or its derivatives.
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of drug on drug indicates that drug inhibits drug metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
substrates, in vitro data suggest similar effects of drug in CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and drug metabolism.
In addition, other drug have been reported to decrease the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of drug.
include drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
drug (drug): The concomitant administration of a drug with a drug may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions.
drug: Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with drug and an drug.
The concurrent use of drug Injection with other drug or medications with anticholinergic activity, such as drug, drug, or drug, may intensify the antimuscarinic effects and may result in an increase in anticholinergic side effects.
Concomitant administration of drug Injection and drug in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time.
Oral doses of drug (10-20 mg/kg), via alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition, significantly reduced the rate of elimination of drug (by approximately 40%) given to healthy volunteers in moderate doses.
Similarly, drug decreased the rate of elimination of drug (by approximately 50%) by the same mechanism.
Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of drug and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug), though this has not been studied
When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with drug: drug, general: exaggeration of the hypotension induced by general drug.
drug (oral agents and drug): hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia;
Elevated plasma levels of drug have been reported with concomitant drug use.
There have been reports of drug-related side effects in patients on concomitant therapy with drug and drug.
Therefore, monitoring of drug plasma levels should be considered and dosage of drug adjusted, as required.
drug have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of drug.

and drug , (drug), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired.
Elevated serum levels of drug have been reported with the concomitant use of some drug and drug.
Therefore, drug serum levels should be monitored and appropriate drug dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.
drug: In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of drug and drug, plasma drug mean cmax and AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and drug mean renal clearance decreased by 14%.
No information is available about the interaction of drug and drug following multiple doses of either drug.
Although not observed in this study, adverse effects could potentially arise from co-administration of drug and drug by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter systems.
Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of drug is recommended in patients concomitantly taking drug and drug.
drug: As with other drug, the renal excretion of drug is inhibited by drug.
Caution should be exercised when administering drug with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities (e.g., drug).
High-dose drug resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/mL administered with oral drug has led to an 80% increase in drug exposure with a 38% decrease in total body clearance of drug compared to drug alone.
drug: Patients on drug, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug.
The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug.
drug Supplements and drug: drug can attenuate potassium loss caused by drug.
drug (drug, drug,drug, and others) or drug supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
drug: Increased serum drug levels and symptoms of drug toxicity have been reported in patients receiving drug during therapy with drug.
drug: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an drug (drug, drug, and drug) with drug reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of drug as compared with drug administered alone, suggesting that drug may impair absorption of drug.
In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug, the bioavailability of drug was not altered by coadministration of drug with any one of these drugs.
In a study with concomitant administration of drug and drug, the bioavailability of unbound drug was not altered.
In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with drug, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of drug were not significantly changed.
Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction drug may cause a false low measurement of serum drug levels with the Digi- Tab  RIA Kit for drug.
Drug Interactions: drug may interact with some drugs, like drug (drug): drug could theoretically affect drug pharmacodynamics - drug - Eproxindine - drug: drug and drug cause additive CNS depression - drug: drug increases the effect of drug
Certain other drug (drug and drug) have also been reported to interfere with the nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction.
drug (eg, drug) and other drugs, including ether, drug, drug, drug and drug, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with drug Parenteral.
drug may enhance the nephrotoxicity of drug Parenteral.
The concomitant use of drug and drug Parenteral should be avoided.
Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on drug, and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug.
The possibility of hypotensive effects with drug can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug.
If it is necessary to continue the drug, initiate therapy with drug at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized.
When a drug is added to the therapy of a patient receiving drug, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed.
Studies with drug in combination with drug indicate that the dose of the drug can be reduced when it is given with a drug.
drug: In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with drug, the co-administration of drug may result in a further deterioration of renal function.
Reports suggest that drug may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug, including drug.
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug concomitantly with drug.
In a study in 36 patients with mild to moderate hypertension where the antihypertensive effects of drug alone were compared to drug given concomitantly with drug, the use of drug was associated with a reduced antihypertensive effect, although the difference between the two regimens was not significant.
Other Agents: drug has been used concomitantly with drug and/or drug without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when drug was used concomitantly with drug or drug.
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: drug attenuates potassium loss caused by drug.
Use of drug with drug (e.g., drug, drug, or drug), drug supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium.
drug: drug toxicity has been reported in patients receiving drug concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including drug.
drug toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of drug and the drug.
It is recommended that serum drug levels be monitored frequently if drug is administered concomitantly with drug.
The CNS effects of drug may be enhanced by drug.
drug, drug and drug may enhance the effects of: other drugs, drug, general drug, drug such as drug, drug, or other drug, causing increased CNS depression.
May interact with wthionamide (drug) and drug (drug).
CNS-Active Drugs drug: drug 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of drug 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after drug administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after drug administration.
drug did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug.
drug: Coadministration of single doses of drug 20 mg and drug 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
drug: Coadministration of a single dose of drug 20 mg and drug 20 mg daily for 7 days did not produce any interaction on psychomotor performance.
Additionally, drug did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug, reflecting the absence of a role of CYP2D6 in drug s metabolism.
drug: Coadministration of single doses of drug 20 mg and drug 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
drug: Coadministration of a single dose of drug 10 mg and multiple doses of drug ER (extended release) 150 mg did not result in any significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either drug or drug.
In addition, there was no pharmacodynamic interaction as a result of coadministration of drug and drug ER.
drug: Coadministration of a single dose of drug and drug (10 and 25 mg, respectively) resulted in a 15% decrease in maximal plasma concentrations of drug, but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
However, the pharmacodynamics of coadministration of drug and drug have not been evaluated.
Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 drug: CYP3A4 is ordinarily a minor metabolizing enzyme of drug.
Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer drug (600 mg every 24 hours, q24h, for 14 days), however, reduced drug Cmax and AUC by approximately 80%.
An alternative non-CYP3A4 substrate drug may be considered in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers such as drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 CYP3A4 is a minor metabolic pathway for the elimination of drug because the sum of desethylzaleplon (formed via CYP3A4 in vitro) and its metabolites, drug and drug, account for only 9% of the urinary recovery of a drug dose.
Coadministration of single, oral doses of drug with drug (10 mg and 800 mg, respectively), a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor produced a 34% increase in drugs maximal plasma concentrations and a 20% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
Other strong selective CYP3A4 inhibitors such as drug can also be expected to increase the exposure of drug.
drug: drug is reported to be a weak inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase in rat liver, but its inhibitory effects in human liver are not known.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug following the administration of a single dose (10 mg and 50 mg, respectively) of each drug.
Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4 drug: drug inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, respectively, responsible for drug metabolism.
Concomitant administration of drug (10 mg) and drug (800 mg) produced an 85% increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of drug.
Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index drug: drug (10 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of drug (0.375 mg q24h for 8 days).
drug: Multiple oral doses of drug (20 mg q24h for 13 days) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug (R+)- or (S-)-enantiomers or the pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time) following a single 25-mg oral dose of drug.
Drugs That Alter Renal Excretion drug: drug is known to affect renal function and, consequently, alter the renal excretion of other drugs.
There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug following single dose administration (10 mg and 600 mg, respectively) of each drug.
This was expected because drug is primarily metabolized and renal excretion of unchanged drug accounts for less than 1% of the administered dose.
A pharmacokinetic study evaluating the administration of a single dose of drug 100 mg with drug 200 mg BID, a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 pathway, showed a 1.7-fold increase in Cmax of drug and a 5.4-fold increase in AUC of drug.
Administration of drug with other CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., drug 500 mg BID, drug 240 mg QD, drug 1200 mg TID, drug 200 mg QD) resulted in increases in Cmax of drug ranging from 1.4- to 1.6- fold and AUC from 2.0- to 2.9- fold.
drug and drug (Congestive Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction)- In EPHESUS, 3020 (91%) patients receiving drug 25 to 50 mg also received drug or drug (drug/drug).
Rates of patients with maximum potassium levels  5.5 mEq/L were similar regardless of the use of drug/drug.
drug and drug (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of drug 50 to 100 mg to drug and drug increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).
In a study in diabetics with microalbuminuria drug 200 mg combined with the drug drug 10 mg increased the frequency of hyperkalemia (serum potassium  5.5 mEq/L) from 17% on drug alone to 38%.
drug-A drug interaction study of drug with drug has not been conducted.
Serum drug levels should be monitored frequently if drug is administered concomitantly with drug.
drug (drug)-A drug interaction study of drug with an drug has not been conducted.
The administration of other drug with drug has been shown to reduce the antihypertensive effect in some patients and result in severe hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function.
Therefore, when drug and drug are used concomitantly, patients should be observed to determine whether the desired effect on blood pressure is obtained.

drug: Because drug may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of drug may be required.
drug: drug may increase the clearance of drug.
drug: Increased activity of both drug and drug may occur when the two are used concurrently.
drug: Patients on drug may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.
drug: drug may enhance the metabolic clearance of drug, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in drug dosage.
drug, including oral drug: drug may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain drug, thereby increasing their effect.
Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug) may enhance the metabolism of drug and require that the dosage of the drug be increased.
Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., drug, drug such as drug) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of drug.
Co-administration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., drug, drug) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration.
drug: drug has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain drug by up to 60%, leading to increased risk of drug side effects.
In addition, drug alone can inhibit adrenal drug synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal.
drug (drug): Concomitant use of drug (or other drug) and drug increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
drug should be used cautiously in conjunction with drug in hypoprothrombinemia.
The clearance of drug may be increased with concurrent use of drug.
drug: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in drug levels with drug co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.
drug: Co-administration with drug should be employed cautiously, as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use.
drug: Patients on drug therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and drug or drug due to inhibition of antibody response.
drug may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in drug.
Routine administration of drug or toxoids should be deferred until drug therapy is discontinued if possible.
drug, a drug, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of drug by competitive inhibition.
THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF drug MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH drug SUCH AS drug, drug AND drug.
Therefore when drug are administered concomitantly with drug their dosage should be reduced.
Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other drug, and cautioned that the effect of drug may be increased.
drug, drug, and drug may increase anticholinergic effect of drug.
drug may decrease the effect of drug, drug, and drug.
Concurrent administration of drug and drug may result in elevated serum levels of drug.
In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of drug may decrease blood glucose and therefore, drug requirements.
drug Inhibitors Felodipine is metabolized by drug.
Co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, drug, drug, drug, grapefruit juice, drug) with drug may lead to several- fold increases in the plasma levels of drug, either due to an increase in bioavailability or due to a decrease in metabolism.
These effects have been observed with co-administration of drug (a potent drug inhibitor).
Caution should be used when drug inhibitors are co-administered with drug.
The following specific interactions have been reported: Itraconazole Co-administration of another extended release formulation of drug with drug resulted in approximately 8-fold increase in the AUC, more than 6- fold increase in the Cmax, and 2-fold prolongation in the half- life of drug.
Erythromycin Co-administration of drug (drug) with drug resulted in approximately 2.5- fold increase in the AUC and Cmax, and about 2- fold prolongation in the half- life of drug.
Grapefruit juice Co-administration of drug with grapefruit juice resulted in more than 2-fold increase in the AUC and Cmax, but no prolongation in the half- life of drug.
Cimetidine Co-administration of drug with drug (a non-specific CYP-450 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the AUC and the Cmax, of drug.
Beta-Blocking Agents  A pharmacokinetic study of drug in conjunction with drug demonstrated no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of drug.
In controlled clinical trials, however, drug including drug were concurrently administered with drug and were well tolerated.
Digoxin  When given concomitantly with drug the pharmacokinetics of drug in patients with heart failure were not significantly altered.
drug: In a pharmacokinetic study, maximum plasma concentrations of drug were considerably lower in epileptic patients on long-term drug therapy (eg, drug, drug, or drug) than in healthy volunteers.
Tacrolimus  drug may increase the blood concentration of drug.
When given concomitantly with drug, the drug blood concentration should be followed and the tacrolimus dose may need to be adjusted.
Other Concomitant Therapy  In healthy subjects there were no clinically significant interactions when drug was given concomitantly with drug or drug.

This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug concomitantly with drug.
drug: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that drug can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug and drug in some patients.
During concomitant therapy of drug with drug, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.
drug: drug have produced an elevation of plasma drug levels and a reduction in renal drug clearance.
Thus, when drug and drug are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of drug toxicity.
drug: The effects of drug and drug on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.
drug: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an drug containing 1.7-gram of drug with 500-mg of drug increased the Cmax and AUC of drug by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including drug, drug and drug.
Oral drug: In some normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of drug and drug, drug, or drug resulted in prolongation of prothrombin time.
This may occur because drug competitively displaces drug from protein binding sites.
Accordingly, when drug is administered with oral drug, the prothrombin time should be closely monitored during and for several days after concomitant drug administration.
drug: In diabetic patients receiving drug and drug, no significant effects were seen on drug plasma levels or fasting blood glucose.
drug: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of drug and drug resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of drug.
drug decreased the hyperuricemic effect of drug.
drug: In normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of drug and drug had no effect on the diuretic activity of drug.
drug decreased the hyperuricemic effect of drug.
drug: Concomitant administration of drug may reduce plasma levels of drug.
This effect is small with occasional doses of drug, but may be clinically significant when drug are used on a continuous schedule.
drug: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of drug and drug resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of drug.
drug had no effect on plasma levels of drug.
Since drug in high doses has been associated with hepatotoxicity, concomitant administration of drug and drug should be used cautiously, with careful monitoring of patients.
Concomitant administration of drug and drug in dogs, but not in rats, at approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human therapeutic dose of each (40 to 52 mg/kg/day of drug/drug) resulted in greater gastrointestinal toxicity than when either drug was administered alone.
drug: Caution should be used if drug is administered concomitantly with drug.
drug have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of drug and to potentiate its toxicity.
drug: Administration of drug concomitantly with drug has been associated with an increase in drug-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
drug should be used with caution in patients taking drug, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
drug: The administration of drug to normal volunteers receiving drug decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of drug.
In some patients the combined use of drug and drug has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Therefore, drug and drug should not be used concomitantly.
The concomitant use of drug tablets and other drug is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy.
drug: In normal volunteers, a small decrease in drug levels was observed when multiple doses of drug and drug were administered concomitantly.
drug: The concomitant administration of drug and drug in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.
drug: The concomitant administration of drug and drug in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of drug, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of drug and its glucuronide metabolite.
drug had no effect on plasma levels of drug.
drug has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other drug.
Antagonism between drug and drug in vitro has been demonstrated.
Careful observation is required when drug is administered concurrently with drug.
Since drug (drug) may interact with concurrently administered drug, periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (eg, drug may elevate drug serum levels and drug has been reported to both increase and decrease drug levels).
Administration of 0.1-mg/kg (2 x ED95) drug at 10% or 95% recovery following an intubating dose of drug (1 mg/kg) produced  95% neuromuscular block.
The time to onset of maximum block following drug is approximately 2 minutes faster with prior administration of drug.
Prior administration of drug had no effect on the duration of neuromuscular block following initial or maintenance bolus doses of drug.
Infusion requirements of drug in patients administered drug prior to infusions of drug were comparable to or slightly greater than when drug was not administered.
The use of drug before drug to attenuate some of the side effects of drug has not been studied.
Although not studied systematically in clinical trials, no drug interactions were observed when drug, drug, or drug were administered following varying degrees of recovery from single doses or infusions of drug.
drug or drug administered with drug/drug to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of drug and decrease the required infusion rate of drug.
Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC drug or drug had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of drug and therefore, no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when drug is administered shortly after initiation of volatile agents.
In long surgical procedures during drug or drug anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of drug may be necessary.
In clinical studies drug had no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirements for drug.
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug such as drug include certain drug (e. g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug), drug salts, drug, local drug, drug, and drug.
Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of drug has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered drug or drug.
While the effects of chronic drug or drug therapy on the action of drug are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher.
drug is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of drug.
drug: In a randomized, multiple-dose crossover study, patients with Type 2 diabetes were administered 120 mg drug three times a day before meals for 1 day in combination with drug 10 mg daily.
drug: When drug 120 mg three times daily before meals was administered in combination with drug 500 mg three times daily to patients with Type 2 diabetes, there were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either agent.
drug: When drug 120 mg before meals was administered in combination with a single 1-mg dose of drug to healthy volunteers, there were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either agent.
drug: When healthy subjects were administered drug 120 mg three times daily before meals for four days in combination with a single dose of drug 30 mg on day 2, there were no alterations in the pharmacokinetics of either agent.
drug: Administration of morning and lunch doses of drug 120 mg in combination with a single 75-mg dose of drug in healthy volunteers resulted in no significant changes to the pharmacokinetics of either agent.
In vitro displacement studies with highly protein-bound drugs such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug showed no influence on the extent of drug protein binding.
Similarly, drug had no influence on the serum protein binding of drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug in vitro .
Certain drugs, including drug (drug), drug, drug, and drug may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of drug and other oral drug.
Certain drugs including drug, drug, drug, and drug may reduce the hypoglycemic action of drug and other oral drug.
drug: Steady-state trough concentrations of drug were about 56% higher when 8 mg drug was coadministered with each dose of drug (15 mg/kg/day) in eight neurocysticercosis patients.
drug: In the fed state, drug (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of drug by about 50% in healthy subjects (n=10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n=6) given drug alone.
The pharmacokinetics of drug were unchanged following coadministration with drug (400 mg).
drug: drug concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with drug (10 mg/kg/day) (n=7) compared with drug (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n=12).
drug: The pharmacokinetics of drug (drug 5.8 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes) were unchanged following a single oral dose of drug (400 mg) in 6 healthy subjects.
Results from existing clinical trials suggest no significant interactions between drug  and other therapies commonly used in MS patients, including the concurrent use of drug for up to 28 days.
drug  has not been formally evaluated in combination with drug.
However, 10 patients who switched from therapy with drug to drug  did not report any serious and unexpected adverse reactions thought to be related to treatment.
The vasodilating effects of drug may be additive with those of other drug.
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect drug: Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for drug metabolism.
Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of drug with drug, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of drug.
Inhibitors of CYP2D6: Because CYP2D6 is involved in drug metabolism, concomitant use of drug with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of drug.
drug (20 mg QD) increased the concentration of drug (40 mg QD) by about 60%, and greater degrees of inhibition are expected with higher doses of drug.
Similar effects would be expected with other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., drug, drug).
Potential for drug to Affect Other Drugs: Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2: In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that drug does not induce CYP1A2 activity, and it is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates.
When drug was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of drug, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of drug increased 3-fold.
Therefore, co-administration of drug with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain drug (drug [drug], such as drug, drug, and drug), drug and drug (e.g., drug, drug), should be approached with caution.
Plasma drug concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of the drug may need to be reduced if a drug is co-administered with drug.
Because of the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of drug, drug and drug should not be co-administered.
drug May Have a Clinically Important Interaction with the Following Other Drugs: drug: When drug and drug were administered several hours apart so that peak concentrations of each would coincide, drug did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by drug.
In the drug clinical trials database, three drug-treated patients had liver injury as manifested by ALT and total bilirubin elevations, with evidence of obstruction.
However, co-administration of drug with drug- and drug-containing drug (51 mEq) or drug with drug, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of drug absorption after administration of a 40-mg oral dose.
It is unknown whether the concomitant administration of drug affects drug absorption.
drug is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered drug.
drug: In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg TID) study of drug in epileptic patients (N=8) maintained on drug monotherapy for at least 2 months, drug had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of drug and drug had no effect on drug pharmacokinetics.
drug: Steady-state trough plasma drug and drug concentrations were not affected by concomitant drug (400 mg TID;
Likewise, drug pharmacokinetics were unaltered by drug administration.
drug: The mean steady-state trough serum drug concentrations prior to and during concomitant drug administration (400 mg TID;
N=17) were not different and neither were drug pharmacokinetic parameters affected by drug.
drug: Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for drug or drug (300 mg TID;
drug: Coadministration (N=18) of drug capsules (250 mg) with drug (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of drug absorbed by 12% to 15%.
drug had no effect on drug pharmacokinetic parameters.
drug: Coadministration of drug  (125 to 500 mg;
Cmax and AUC values are 3% to 4% lower, respectively, after administration of 125 mg drug  and 21% to 22% lower, respectively, after administration of 500 mg drug .
drug increases drug AUC values by 14%.
drug: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release drug capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg drug  capsule (N=12), mean drug AUC increased by 44% compared to drug administered without drug.
drug pharmacokinetic parameter values were not affected by administration of drug  2 hours after drug.
drug: In the presence of drug at 300 mg QID (N=12) the mean apparent oral clearance of drug fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%.
Thus drug appeared to alter the renal excretion of both drug and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
This small decrease in excretion of drug by drug is not expected to be of clinical importance.
The effect of drug on drug was not evaluated.
Oral drug: Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of drug and drug following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of drug and 50 mcg of drug were similar with and without coadministration of drug (400 mg TID;
The Cmax of drug was 13% higher when it was coadministered with drug;
drug (drug ): drug reduced the bioavailability of drug (N=16) by about 20%.
This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when drug was administered 2 hours after drug.
It is recommended that drug be taken at least 2 hours following drug administration.
Effect of drug: drug is a blocker of renal tubular secretion.
drug pharmacokinetic parameters without and with drug were comparable.
This indicates that drug does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by drug.
Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG dipstick test for urinary protein when drug was added to other drug, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein
In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between drug and other highly bound drugs, such as drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Treatment with drug coadministered with drug/drug does not change these effects.
No interaction was noted with the drug drug in two multiple-dose interaction studies when drug was coadministered with a drug/drug (n=29).
More than 600 Parkinsons disease patients in clinical trials have used drug in combination with drug and drug/drug.
As most drug excretion is via the bile, caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion, glucuronidation, and intestinal beta-glucuronidase are given concurrently with drug.
These include drug, drug, and some drug (e.g. drug, rifamipicin, drug and drug).
No interaction with the drug drug was shown in a single-dose study with drug without coadministered drug/drug.
It is, however, possible that concomitant use of other known drug such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug and drug might increase the photosensitivity reaction of actinic keratoses treated with the drug for Topical Solution.
drug: There is no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug which has been confirmed clinically.
drug also has no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug, as shown in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in two other cell lines (U937 and Molt-4).
In the same study it was shown that drug and drug had no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
drug: In vitro studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, U937 and Molt-4 cells revealed that drug significantly inhibited drug phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner.
drug inhibited drug phosphorylation at high concentration ratios (10 and 100);
however, it is considered to be unlikely that this decrease of phosphorylated drug concentration is of clinical significance, as drug is a more efficient substrate for deoxycytidine kinase than drug.
These in vitro studies suggest that concomitant administration of drug and drug in humans may result in sub-therapeutic concentrations of active phosphorylated drug, which may lead to a decreased drug effect of drug.
Concomitant use of drug and drug is not recommended.
drug: The combination of drug, drug, and drug has been studied (as triple combination) in adults.
Drugs that have been associated with peripheral neuropathy include drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Concomitant use of drug with drug is not recommended.
Intravenous drug: Treatment with drug should be interrupted when the use of a drug that has the potential to cause pancreatitis is required.
Death due to fulminant pancreatitis possibly related to intravenous drug and drug has been reported.
If intravenous drug is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with drug should be interrupted.
drug, drug, and drug: Drugs such as drug, drug, and drug may increase the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy or other drug-associated adverse events by interfering with the renal clearance of drug (thereby raising systemic exposure).
drug or drug: Concomitant administration of drug or drug decreases the elimination of drug, most likely by inhibition of renal tubular secretion of drug.
Patients receiving these drugs in combination with drug should be monitored for signs of toxicity and the dose of drug reduced if warranted.
drug/drug-containing drug: Absorption of drug is moderately reduced (approximately 25%) when coadministered with drug/drug-containing drug.
The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence drug is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with drug/drug-containing drug.
drug: Bioavailability is mildly reduced (approximately 10%) when drug and drug are coadministered.
drug: drug caused a decrease in drug phosphorylation ( 50% inhibition of total phosphate formation) in U937/Molt 4 cells.
drug: drug (drug, drug, drug, drug, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of drug.
drug (drug, drug, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the drug molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
drug: drug are inhibited by drug.
Alkalinizing agents: Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (drug, etc.) increase absorption of drug.
Urinary alkalinizing agents (drug, some drug) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the drug molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
drug, drug: drug may enhance the activity of drug or drug;
drug with drug or drug and possibly other drug cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of drug in the brain;
drug: drug, as well as a metabolite of drug, slow drug metabolism.

drug: The stimulatory effects of drug may be inhibited by drug.
drug: drug potentiate the analgesic effect of drug.
drug therapy: Urinary excretion of drug is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by drug used in drug therapy.
drug: drug enhance the adrenergic effect of drug.
drug: drug may delay intestinal absorption of drug;
drug: drug may delay intestinal absorption of drug;
drug: In cases of drug overdosage, drug CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.
drug: drug inhibit the hypotensive effect of drug.
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: drug can cause a significant elevation in plasma drug levels.
drug (10 mg once daily) has been coadministered with therapeutic doses of drug, drug, and drug in controlled clinical pharmacology studies in adult volunteers.
Although increased plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of drug and/or drug were observed following coadministration of drug with each of these drugs in normal volunteers (n = 24 in each study), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of drug, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.
No effects on plasma concentrations of drug or drug were observed.
Plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of drug decreased 15% with coadministration of drug relative to that observed with drug alone.
TABLE 1 Effects on Plasma Concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of drug and drug After 10 Days of Coadministration (drug 10 mg) in Normal Volunteers
drug drug
There does not appear to be an increase in adverse events in subjects who received oral drug and drug.
Tablet If a patient receiving drug is also taking drug, the effect of drug may be reduced, thus necessitating an increase in dosage.
drug may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of drug, drug or other drug.
drug in combination with drug enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection drug may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of drug, drug or other drug.
drug may potentiate the hypotensive effects of drug.
drug may antagonize the hypotensive effects of drug.
The effects of drug on drugs analgesic actions are not known.
drug may exacerbate the hypertensive response seen with drug withdrawl.
Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving drug with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., drug, drug, and drug.)
There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of drug and oral drug.
Symptoms resolved when drug was withdrawn and recurred when the patient was rechallenged with drug.
Epidural drug may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local drug, including both sensory and motor blockade.
In addition, several drug s that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma concentrations of drug and drug.
Results demonstrate that drug and its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (drug) have little or no capacity to function as inhibitors for most of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP4A9 and CYP4A11) with the exception of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.
Although inhibition of CYP 3A4/5 by drug and drug did occur at high concentrations, it is not likely to be of clinical significance.
The inhibition of CYP-2C19 by drug and drug, however, is clinically relevant.
Increases of 22% with drug and 47% with drug were observed.
As drug, the predominant plasma substrate, is only a weak inducer of UDP-glucuronyl transferase, it is unlikely to have an effect on drugs that are mainly eliminated by conjugation through UDP-glucuronyl transferase (e.g., drug, drug).
In addition, drug and drug induce a subgroup of the cytochrome P450 3A family (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) responsible for the metabolism of drug and oral drug, resulting in a lower plasma concentration of these drugs.
drug: Potential interactions between drug and other drug were assessed in clinical studies.
Influence of drug on drug Concentration (Mean change, 90% Confidence Interval)
Influence of drug On drug Concentration (Mean change, 90% Confidence Interval)
1- nc denotes a mean change of less than 10% 2- Pediatrics 3- Mean increase in adults at high drug doses In vivo, the plasma levels of drug increased by up to 40%, when drug was given at doses above 1200 mg/day.
Therefore, when using doses of drug greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of drug may be required.
The increase of drug level, however, is small (15%) when given with drug.
Strong inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (i.e. drug, drug and drug) have been shown to decrease the plasma levels of drug (29-40%).
Hormonal drug Co-administration of drug with an oral drug has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components, drug (EE) and drug (LNG).
Therefore, concurrent use of drug with drug may render these drug less effective.
drugs: After repeated co-administration of drug, the AUC of drug was lowered by 28% [90% CI: 20-33].
drug produced a decrease of 20% [90% CI: 18-27] of the plasma levels of drug.
Other drug interactions drug, drug and drug had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug.
Results with drug wshow no evidence of interaction with either single or repeated doses of drug.
Administration of drug to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with drug may cause hypercalcemia.
- drug may enhance the CNS depressive effects of drug, drug and other drug
- drug may enhance the effects of drug therapy
- Concomitant use of drug may reduce the efficacy of drug.
Oral drug Multiple doses of drug had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug, the estrogenic component in most oral drug.
Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that drug be taken concomitantly with drug.
drug: Co-administration of a single dose of intravenously administered drug (20 mg) reduced the oral absorption of a single 400 mg dose of drug administered following a meal, as evidenced by a 27% decrease in mean Cmax and a 22% decrease in mean AUC.
Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that drug be taken concomitantly with drug.
drug: As with other drug, co-administration of drug with drug resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of drug, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
When drug and drug are used together, the signs of atropinization (flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, dryness of the mouth and nose) may occur earlier than might be expected than when drug is used alone because drug may potentiate the effect of drug.
The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning although they do not bear directly on the use of drug and drug.
Since drug are potentiated by the drug, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions.
drug should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a drug orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
Close observation of the patient is recommended when a drug is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as drug, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by drug-containing oral drug.
Several drug interaction studies have been completed with both drug and drug.
Observations from drug interaction studies with drug may not be predictive for drug.
Because drug is coadministered, prescribers should also refer to the prescribing information for drug regarding drug interactions associated with this agent.
Additional drugs that are not recommended for coadministration with drug and drug are included below.
Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With drug/drug
drug: drug, drug, drug, drug, drug CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions.
drug: drug*, drug* CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.
drug: drug, drug, drug, drug CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and life-threatening reactions such as acute drug toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues.
drug: drug CONTRAINDICATED since the coadministration of this product with drug in an drug regimen reduces the plasma concentrations of drug.
Garlic Capsules Garlic capsules should not be used while taking drug (drug) as the sole drug due to the risk of decreased drug plasma concentrations.
No data are available for the coadministration of drug/drug or drug/drug and garlic capsules.
drug: drug, drug WARNING potential for serious reactions such as risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.
drug/drug: drug, drug CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression.
Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with drug;
Since drug is coadministered with drug, the drug label should be reviewed for additional drugs that should not be coadministered.
Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, drug, drug, drug, drug) may result in decreased plasma levels of drug.
In vitro mixing of an drug with beta-lactamtype drug (drug or drug) may result in a significant mutual inactivation.
Even when an drug and a drug-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in drug serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
drug:Clinical evidence has shown that drug can be formed with concurrent ingestion of drug and drug.
drug: In a study of 7 healthy male volunteers, drug treatment potentiated the blood glucose lowering effect of drug (a drug similar to drug) in 3 of the 7 subjects.
Repeating the study with 6 healthy male volunteers in the absence of drug did not detect an effect of drug on glucose tolerance.
drug: It has not been established if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug.
However, it has been established that drug interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed drug minipill preparations.
Microdosed minipill drug preparations are not recommended for use with drug.
It is not known whether other drug, such as implants and injectables, are adequate methods of contraception during drug therapy.
drug: An increased risk of hepatitis has been reported to result from combined use of drug and drug.
Consequently, the combination of drug with drug is also contraindicated.
drug: If drug is given concurrently with drug, the protein binding of drug may be reduced.
drug: Since both drug and drug can cause increased intracranial pressure, their combined use is contraindicated.
drug and oral drug: Concomitant administration of drug and/or other oral drug with drug must be avoided because of the risk of hypervitaminosis A.
Other: There appears to be no pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug, drug, or drug.
Investigations into the effect of drug on the protein binding of drug (drug) revealed no interaction.
Use of drug in a patient who has previously received drug increases the risk of cardiotoxicity.
drug should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of drug or drug.
drug used concurrently with drug may also result in increased cardiotoxicity.
drug: Since drug is contraindicated in patients with drug-induced thrombocytopenia, the co-administration of drug and drug is unlikely for this indication.
However, if drug is to be initiated after cessation of drug therapy, allow sufficient time for heparins effect on the aPTT to decrease prior to initiation of drug therapy.
drug/drug: Pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions have not been demonstrated between drug and concomitantly administered drug (162.5 mg orally given 26 and 2 hours prior to initiation of drug 1  g/kg/min. over 4 hours) or drug (1000 mg orally given 12, 6 and 0 hours prior to, and 6 and 12 hours subsequent to, initiation of drug 1.5  g/kg/min. over 18 hours).
Oral drug: Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between drug and drug (7.5 mg single oral dose) have not been demonstrated.
However, the concomitant use of drug and drug (5-7.5 mg initial oral dose followed by 2.5-6 mg/day orally for 6-10 days) results in prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR).
drug: The safety and effectiveness of drug with drug have not been established.
Co-administration: Concomitant use of drug with drug, drug, and other drug may increase the risk of bleeding.
Drug-drug interactions have not been observed between drug and drug or drug.
drug: Reports suggest that drug may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug.
In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 25 mg daily of drug with the drug drug, 10 to 40 mg for 4 weeks, was associated with an average increase in mean arterial pressure of about 3 mm Hg compared to drug alone.
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug concomitantly with drug.
drug: Concomitant administration of low-dose drug with drug may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of drug alone.
In a 12-week endoscopy study conducted in OA patients there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of endoscopic gastroduodenal ulcers in patients taking low-dose (81 mg) enteric coated drug plus drug 25 mg daily, as compared to those taking drug 2400 mg daily alone.
Patients taking low-dose drug plus drug were not studied.
At steady state, drug 50 mg once daily had no effect on the anti-platelet activity of low-dose (81 mg once daily) drug, as assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregation and serum TXB2 generation in clotting blood.
Because of its lack of platelet effects, drug is not a substitute for drug for cardiovascular prophylaxis.
Prospective, long-term studies on concomitant administration of drug and drug have not been conducted.
drug: Co-administration with high doses of drug [800 mg twice daily] increased the Cmax of drug by 21%, the AUC0-120hr by 23% and the t1/2 by 15%.
drug: drug 75 mg once daily for 11 days does not alter the plasma concentration profile or renal elimination of drug after a single 0.5 mg oral dose.
drug: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that drug can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug and drug in some patients.
drug: drug 400 mg daily did not have any clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug.
drug: drug have produced an elevation of plasma drug levels and a reduction in renal drug clearance.
Thus, when drug and drug are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of drug toxicity.
drug drug 12.5, 25, and 50 mg, each dose administered once daily for 7 days, had no effect on the plasma concentration of drug as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving single weekly drug doses of 7.5 to 20 mg for rheumatoid arthritis.
At higher than recommended doses, drug 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23% as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving drug 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis.
At 24 hours postdose, a similar proportion of patients treated with drug alone (94%) and subsequently treated with drug co-administered with 75 mg of drug (88%) had drug plasma concentrations below the measurable limit (5 ng/mL).
Standard monitoring of drug-related toxicity should be continued if drug and drug are administered concomitantly.
Oral drug drug did not have any clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug.
drug/drug: drug did not have any clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug or drug.
drug: Co-administration of drug with drug 600 mg daily, a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism, produced an approximate 50% decrease in drug plasma concentrations.
Therefore, a starting daily dose of 25 mg of drug should be considered for the treatment of osteoarthritis when drug is co-administered with potent inducers of hepatic metabolism.
drug drug 12.5, 25, and 50 mg administered once daily for 7 days increased plasma drug concentrations (AUC(0- )) by 38 to 60% in healthy subjects administered a single 300-mg dose of drug.
Adequate monitoring of drug plasma concentrations should be considered when therapy with drug is initiated or changed in patients receiving drug.
Therefore, there is a potential for an interaction with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 1A2 (e.g., drug, drug, and drug).
drug: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing drug therapy in patients receiving drug or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications.
In single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects receiving both drug and drug, prothrombin time (measured as INR) was increased by approximately 8% to 11%.
In post-marketing experience, bleeding events have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving drug concurrently with drug.
drug should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as drug, drug, drug, or drug.
Studies have shown that drug does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, or drug in healthy subjects.
When drug was administered concomitantly with drug (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of drug was seen.
Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their drug dosage when drug is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
drug has also been shown to have no clinically significant interaction with drug.
In a single-dose crossover study examining drug 30 mg and drug 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with drug 1 gram, absorption of the drug was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with drug.
Therefore, drug should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to drug.
In clinical trials, drug were administered concomitantly with drug delayed-release capsules;
therefore, it is theoretically possible that drug may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. drug, drug esters, drug salts, drug).
A similar association, though less marked, has been suggested with drug, phenyl-butazone, drug, drug and possibly with drug, drug, and drug (72)
Considerable caution should be exercised if drug is administered concurrently with drug (drug) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
A two-way interaction between the drug, drug, and the drugs has been suggested.
Presumably, drug acts as a stimulator of drug metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the drug and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
Conversely, the drug have been reported to increase the serum levels and prolong the serum half-life of drug by inhibiting its metabolism.
Although there is no documentation of such, a similar interaction between drug and the drug may occur.
Caution is therefore advised when administering drug to patients receiving drug.
Patients on drug therapy may require dosage adjustment of the anticoagulant during and after drug therapy.
Concomitant use of drug usually depresses drug activity and may necessitate raising the dosage.
The concomitant administration of drug has been reported to reduce the efficacy of oral drug and to increase the incidence of breakthrough bleeding.
In clinical studies, drug has been co-administered with other anti-asthma medications, including inhaled and oral drug, and inhaled drug, with no evidence of increased frequency of adverse events or laboratory abnormalities.
drug : drug is known to interact with the metabolism or renal tubular excretion of many drugs (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug agents, drug, and drug).
drug should either be temporarily discontinued or decreased by 50% when coadministered with drug on the day of drug infusion.
Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of drug and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous drug (e.g., drug, drug, and drug), drug, drug, intravenous drug, drug, and drug] is contraindicated.
Drug-Drug Interactions: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug and other drug have not been determined.
However, interactions may be expected, and drug should NOT be used in combination with other drug.
Since drug is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of drug with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either drug or the coadministered drug.
Coadministration of drug with drug, drug,or drug did not result in significant drug interactions.
The effects of coadministration of drug with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated, and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when drug is coadministered with such drugs.
The risk of a potential interaction between drug and drug concentrates has not been adequately evaluated in preclinical or clinical studies.
Simultaneous use of drug or drug should be avoided.
Although the specific drug interaction was not studied in a clinical trial, there have been more than 50 episodes of concomitant use of antifibrinolytic therapies (i.e., drug, drug) and drug.
drug may decrease drug response to drug.
No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs, or drugs used during anesthesia (drug, intravenous agents, and local drug) were reported in clinical trials.
Like drug, drug does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused drug in swine.
drug including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and drug such as drug (drug), and drug may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with drug.
Interactions for drug (drug, drug, drug, and drug): drug: drug has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of drug;
drug/drug: The coadministration of drug or drug will not affect plasma concentrations of drug, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of drug/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
Since blood level of drug/ergocalcitriol will be reduced, higher doses of drug may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously.
drug: drug are known to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine.
Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of drug with drug causes hypercalcemia.
drug: drug dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with drug, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
drug: drug may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of drug.
However, in vivo drug interaction studies of drug with drug have not been investigated.
drug: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between drug, which promote calcium absorption, and drug, which inhibit calcium absorption.
drug: The coadministration of any of the drug should be avoided as this could create possible additive effects and hypercalcemia.
drug Supplements: Uncontrolled intake of additional drug-containing preparations should be avoided.
drug: drug-containing preparations (eg, drug) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with drug by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
drug  (drug) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with drug.
Because of reports of prolongation of the prothrombin time beyond the therapeutic range in patients taking concurrent drug and drug, it is suggested that the prothrombin time be monitored carefully, and the dose of drug or other drug-like drugs should be adjusted accordingly, in patients taking both drugs.
Certain drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Use with drug: The principal pathway for detoxification of drug is inhibited by drug.
Patients receiving drug and drug concomitantly should have a dose reduction of drug, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose.
Use with drug: The use of drug to control hypertension in patients on drug has been reported to induce severe leukopenia.
For information on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug in combination, see Drug Interactions under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section.
No Important Interactions To Date drug does not have clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug or drug.
drug - Although drug did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of drug in a clinical trial, as with other drug, the use of drug by patients taking drug is not recommended.
drug (drug)
Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (drug, drug, drug, etc.)
Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of drug that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an drug or drug potentiated the risk of bleeding.
drug - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic drug, combined administration of 400 mg/day drug for 8 days resulted in an increase in drug AUC and Cmax of 43% and 39%, respectively.
drug - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic drug, combined administration of drug and drug (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug or drug.
drug - Coadministration of racemic drug (40 mg/day for 10 days) and drug (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug or drug.
Nevertheless, plasma drug levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the drug dose in accordance with standard clinical practice.
Because drug may enhance the serotonergic effects of drug, caution should be exercised when drug and drug are coadministered.
drug and drug - In a controlled study, a single dose of drug 2 mg co-administered with racemic drug 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to drug given alone.
Racemic drug did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of drug.
drug - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a drug (drug) and drug.
If concomitant treatment with drug and an drug (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
drug - Combined administration of racemic drug (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate drug (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug.
The effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug was not evaluated.
drug - Administration of 40 mg/day racemic drug for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug, a CYP3A4 substrate.
drug - Combined administration of racemic drug (40 mg/day for 14 days) and drug (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug, a CYP3A4 substrate.
Although trough drug plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of drug, the possibility that drug might increase the clearance of drug should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
drug - Combined administration of racemic drug (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate drug (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug or drug.
drug - Combined administration of racemic drug (40 mg) and drug (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of drug by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug.
drug - Combined administration of a single dose of drug (600 mg), both a CYP3A4 substrate and a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and drug (20 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug or drug.
However, coadministration of drug (20 mg) and drug (600 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug.
Because drug is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease drug clearance.
In addition, steady state levels of racemic drug were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of drug, suggesting that coadministration, with drug, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on drug metabolism.
However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for drug, i.e., coadministration of drug (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the drug drug (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of drug.
drug - Administration of 20 mg/day drug for 21 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 50% increase in Cmax and 82% increase in AUC of the drug drug (given in a single dose of 100 mg).
Coadministration of drug and drug had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.
Concomitant Administration with Racemic drug drug - Since drug is the active isomer of racemic drug (drug), the two agents should not be coadministered.
drug accelerates the metabolism of drug;
therefore, if drug replacement is needed, drug should be prescribed.
drug diminishes the effect of drug and drug.
In patients using drug (drug and others), plasma levels of calcium, potassium and magnesium must be carefully monitored.
drug: A clinical study in 6 insulin-dependent diabetic patients demonstrated no effect of drug on drug absorption from the peritoneal cavity or on drugs ability to control blood glucose when drug was administered intraperitoneally with drug.
However, appropriate monitoring of blood glucose should be performed when initiating drug in diabetic patients and drug dosage should be adjusted if needed.
drug: No human drug interaction studies with drug were conducted.
In vitro studies demonstrated no evidence of incompatibility of drug with drug.
drug: No human drug interaction studies with drug were conducted.
In vitro studies evaluating the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of drug, drug, drug, drug/flucoxacillin, drug, drug, and drug demonstrated no evidence of incompatibility of these drug with drug.
The hypotensive effect of drug is augmented by that of most other drug, including drug, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled drug.
CNS-Active Drugs drug An additive effect on psychomotor performance was seen with coadministration of drug and drug 0.70 g/kg for up to 4 hours after drug administration.
drug: Coadministration of single doses of drug 3 mg and drug 20 mg daily for 7 days produced no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction.
drug: Coadministration of single doses of drug 3 mg and drug 2 mg did not have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of either drug.
drug: Coadministration of drug 3 mg and drug 10 mg produced a decrease in DSST scores.
Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 (drug) CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of drug.
The AUC of drug was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of drug, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days.
Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug) would be expected to behave similarly.
Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 (drug) Racemic drug exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant useof drug, a potent inducer of CYP3A4.
Drugs With A Narrow Therapeutic Index drug A single dose of drug 3 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug measured at steady state following dosing of 0.5 mg twice daily for one day and 0.25 mg daily for the next 6 days.
drug: drug 3 mg administered daily for 5 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics ofdrug- or drug, nor were there any changes in the pharmacodynamic profile (prothrombin time) following a single 25 mg oral dose of drug
drug has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other drug.
Antagonism has been demonstrated between drug and drug in vitro.
drug: Aerosol drug of the short-acting adrenergic stimulant type may be used for relief of breakthrough symptoms while using drug.
Concomitant administration of other drug may potentiate the undesirable effects of drug.
drug and drug: drug should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with drug or drug because the action of drug on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
drug, drug and drug: Concomitant treatment with drug, drug, or drug may potentiate a possible hypokalemic effect of  drug
Other Drugs:Drugs such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug may be associated with QT-interval prolongation and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
It is important that patients understand how to use drug  (drug) capsules with the supplied AerolizerTM inhalation device and how it should be used in relation to other asthma or COPD medications they are taking.
Acute symptoms should be treated with a short-acting, inhaled  drug such as drug (the physician should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used).
drug should not be used as a substitute for oral or inhaled drug.
Guardians of children who have been prescribed drug should be alerted to the general concern regarding asthma therapy compliance, especially neglect of anti-inflammatory therapy and overuse of drug.
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving drug even though drug has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs.
drug has been administered to patients receiving drug or drug without adverse effects.
During administration of multiple oral doses of drug to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of drug, a 13%-19% increase in plasma drug levels occurred at six hours postdose.
In a study involving healthy subjects receiving drug and drug concurrently, plasma drug levels were increased about 20% and drug levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
In this formal interaction study, drug and drug were each found to have negative inotropic effects;
The effects of concomitant administration of drug and drug on the PR interval were less than additive.
In drug clinical trials, patients who were receiving drug concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects.
Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of drug and drug should be recognized.
drug has been used in a large number of patients receiving drug without apparent interaction.
Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( drug, drug, drug ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of drug elimination.

SINCE drug drug MAY BIND OTHER DRUGS GIVEN CONCURRENTLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PATIENTS TAKE OTHER DRUGS AT LEAST 1 HOUR BEFORE OR 4 TO 6 HOURS AFTER drug drug (OR AT AS GREAT AN INTERVAL AS POSSIBLE) TO AVOID IMPEDING THEIR ABSORPTION.
Agents that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes and/or Epoxide Hydrolase drug is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to the active drug, which is further metabolized to the trans-diol by epoxide hydrolase.

Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of drug, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for drug may be necessary.
Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of drug are the following: drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug(2), drug, drug, and drug Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on drug, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for drug may be necessary.
Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of drug due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes drug is known to induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4.
Agents that have been found, or are expected to have decreased plasma levels in the presence of drug due to induction of CYP enzymes are the following: drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, oral drug(3), drug, drug(4), drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug(5) , drug, and drug.

Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with drug Concomitant administration of drug and drug may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.
Given the anticonvulsant properties of drug, drug may reduce the thyroid function as has been reported with other drug.
Additionally, drug, such as drug and drug, may antagonize the activity of drug.
Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when drug is taken with other drug and drug.
In patients receiving another drug in combination with drug (drug), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma.
Therefore, it is recommended that drug Tablets not be used in combination with drug, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a drug.
After stopping drug Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a drug.
Potential drug, drug, and drug Interactions
drug, drug and drug are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that drug, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
Increased plasma concentrations of drug, drug, and drug cause QT prolongation and have been associated with torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia, sometimes fatal.
As noted below, a sub- for drug in combination with drug, a drug that is known to be metabolized by the IIIA4 isozyme.
Although it has not been definitively demonstrated that drug is a potent IIIA4 inhibitor, it is likely to be, given the substantial interaction of drug with drug.
Consequently, it is recommended that drug not be used in combination with either drug, drug, or drug.
Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: drug: drug metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., drug, drug, drug elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by drug.
The clearance of drug metabolized by glucuronidation (e. g., drug, drug, drug) is unlikely to be affected by drug.
drug: When drug (100 mg qd) and drug (1 mg q.d. were co-administered to steady state, plasma concentration and other pharmacokinetics parameters (AUC, Cmax, T1/2,) of drug were approximately twice those observed when drug was administered alone;
This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of drug, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since drug exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If drug is co-administered with drug Tablets, the initial drug dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
drug: The co-administration of drug Tablets and drug is generally not advisable.
Because drug reduces the clearance of both drug and its active metabolite, drug, there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic co-administration.
Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer drug and drug is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of drug were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of drug.
In these subjects (R= B), the clearance of drug was reduced by 65% and that of drug to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study.
Moreover, as noted with drug, the effect of drug may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
Accordingly, drug and drug should not ordinarily be co-administered.
drug: The effect of steady-state drug l50 mg bid on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug (375 mg) as 442 mg drug was evaluated in 12 healthy non-smoking, male volunteers.
Therefore, if drug is co-administered with drug, its dose should be reduced to one third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of drug should to monitored.
drug: When drug (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with drug for two weeks, drug plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
Thus patients receiving oral drug and drug Tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their drug dose adjusted accordingly.
Therefore, caution should be used when administering drug concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., drug).
No drugs are known to interfere with the conversion of drug to drug.
Conversion could be affected by alterations in the level of phosphatase activity, but given the abundance and wide distribution of phosphatases in the body it is unlikely that drugs would affect this activity enough to affect conversion of drug to drug.
The pharmacokinetics and protein binding of drug, drug, and drug were not altered when drug and drug were concurrently administered in single submaximal doses.
The most significant drug interactions following administration of drug are expected to occur with drugs that interact with drug.
The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma drug concentrations include: acute drug intake, drug, chboramphenicol, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug
- Drugs that may decrease plasma drug concentrations include: drug, chronic drug abuse, drug
- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma drug concentrations include: drug, vaiproic acid, and drug.
Similarly, the effects of drug on drug, drug and sodium plasma drug concentrations are unpredictable
- Although not a true drug interaction, drug may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and drug dosage may need to be adjusted
- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by drug include: drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, oral drug, drug, drug, drug, drug.
Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure plasma drug concentrations following drug administration.
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, drug) may have an additive effect when given with drugs.
drug may also have an additive effect when given with drug .
drug may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of drug.
If the two drugs are coadministered, the drug should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of drug.
If replacing drug by drug therapy, the introduction of drug should be delayed for several days after drug administration has stopped.
Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, drug, may decrease the hypotensive effects of drug.
Information on concurrent usage of drug and drug is limited.

In clinical trials, drug was used with drug, drug, drug, oral drug, and supplemental drug.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving drug or drug in whom therapy with drug was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for drug (n = 23) and drug (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
However, patients on drug may show elevations of drug concentrations after initiation of therapy with drug, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to drug toxicity.
drug - drug may counteract the antinaturetic effect of drug.
drug - drug may increase the absorption of drug if taken concomitantly.
Organic drug - drug supplements theoretically may potentiate the effects of organic drug if taken concomitantly.

drug) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other drug, drug, and the drug drug and drug).
While all the drug (drug), e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.
The extent to which drug-drug interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug involved.
Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of drug with any of the drug and also in switching from one class to the other.
Concomitant use of drug with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug or the other drug.
It is desirable to monitor drug plasma levels whenever a drug is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

If drug therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving drug careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.
drug: In a study in healthy volunteers, a six-day course of drug at 600 mg/day followed by a single 5 mg dose of drug resulted in a reduction in drug levels to below detectable limits.
If drug therapy is required, drug concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of drug.
drug: In a study in healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between drug and racemic drug was seen when two single oral doses of drug (0.7 mg/kg body weight) were administered during 11 days of multipledose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. drug.

Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with drug and drug and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.
For comprehensive information concerning laboratory test alterations associated with drug, physicians should refer to the complete prescribing information for drug (drug).
drug may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with drug therapy.
drug: Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of drug and drug is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina.
Long Acting drug: drug may be safely co-administered with drug, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination.
drug: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated drug levels, and there is a possible interaction between drug and drug, it is recommended that drug levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing drug to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
Extended Release Tablets: Administration of drug with drug increased drug levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers.
Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated drug levels, it is recommended that drug levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing drug to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.

The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of drug on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of drug.
If drug therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving drug, cautious titration is advised.
Interactions for drug analogues (drug, drug, drug, and drug): drug: drug has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of drug;
drug/drug: The coadministration of drug or drug will not affect plasma concentrations of drug, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of drug/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.

drug) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other drug, drug, and the Type 1C antiarrhythrnics propatenone and drug).
While all the drug (drug), e.g., drug, seriraline, and drug, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.
The extent to which drug-drug interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug involved.
Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of drug with any of the drug and also in switching from one class to the other.
Concomitant use of drug with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug or the other drug.
It is desirable to monitor drug plasma levels whenever a drug is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.
Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when this drug is given concomitantly with drug or drug.
If drug is to be combined with other drug such as drug or drug/drug, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of drug and drug (e.g., drug or drug) are additive.

The amount of drug absorbed while taking drug was bioequivalent to the amount absorbed when taking placebo, as indicated by the plasma AUC values.
However, the peak plasma level of drug was reduced by approximately 20% when taking drug due to a slight delay in the absorption of drug.
There is little if any clinically significant interaction between drug and drug.
drug may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of drug or drug;
drug is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4, but coadministration of drug, a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, has no significant effect on drug pharmacokinetics.
Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to drug.
drug is metabolized to drug by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme group, specifically cytochromes P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2C8.
In view of the long and variable half-life of drug, potential for drug interactions exists not only with concomitant medication but also with drugs administered after discontinuation of drug.
Since drug is a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, drugs/substances that inhibit these isoenzymes may decrease the metabolism and increase serum concentration of drug.
Reported examples include the following: drug: drug are known to inhibit CYP3A4 to varying degrees.
A case report of one patient taking drug 200 mg and drug 800 mg three times a day resulted in increases in drug concentrations from 0.9 mg/L to 1.3 mg/L.

Plasma levels of drug have been reported to increase in the presence of oral drug;
because of this, the dosage of drug should be adjusted when these drug are administered concomitantly.
Combination of drug with other drug therapy should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent or incompletely responsive to drug.
During transfer to oral drug, the dose levels of previously administered agents should be reduced by 30 to 50% several days after the addition of oral drug.
The continued need for the other drug agent should be reviewed after the effects of drug have been established, and discontinuation ordinarily should be attempted.
In drug-treated patients who require additional drug therapy, the initial dose of such agents should be approximately half of the usual recommended dose.
drug: drug should be used with caution in patients receiving  -drug blocking agents (e.g., drug, a drug inhibitor) or drug antagonists (e.g., drug, a drug substrate, and drug, a drug inhibitor) because of the possible potentiation of bradycardia, sinus arrest, and AV block;
drug: Potentiation of drug-type (drug and drug substrate) drug response is almost always seen in patients receiving drug and can result in serious or fatal bleeding.
Since the concomitant administration of drug with drug increases the prothrombin time by 100% after 3 to 4 days, the dose of the drug should be reduced by one-third to one-half, and prothrombin times should be monitored closely.

drug blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by drug without preventing its hypotensive effect.
If drug is used with drug in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur.
Care should be taken if drug is used concomitantly with drugs of the drug type.
drug has also been reported to produce a false positive test for drug when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods Toxi-Lab A  (thin-layer chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u.  (radioenzymatic assay).
When patients being treated with drug have a positive urine test for drug using these techniques confirmation should be made by using more specific methods such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique.

drug should not be used in patients receiving drug..
Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of drug 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with drug (drug, drug, drug, drug, drug) should be considered.
drug have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic drug.
An additive hypotensive effect has been reported with the combination of systemic drug and drug therapy.
Since drug may reduce pulse and blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as drug (ophthalmic and systemic), drug, and drug is advised.
When drug or drug is used at the same time as other medicines or substances the following interactions must be taken into account: - drug and drug may enhance the action of drug.
For this reason, the dose of the drug should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with drug or drug retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
- The action of drug and drug may be enhanced by drug or drug.
- In isolated cases, a pronounced though reversible, impairment of renal function (accompanied by a corresponding increase in the serum creatinine level) has been reported in organ transplant patients receiving drug therapy and concomitant drug.

drug, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, certain drug, drug, drug and drug, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the drug dose may be necessary when drug is administered concomitantly.
Interaction with drug, drug and drug has also been reported to produce adverse clinical effects.
However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either drug 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of drug (drug , Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state drug peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older.

drug can interact with drug or other drug (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug), drug or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with drug), and drug (concurrent use with drug may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of drug).
In a Phase I trial using escalating doses of drug (110-200 mg/m2) and drug (50 or 75 mg/m2) given as sequential infusions, myelosuppression was more profound when drug was given after drug than with the alternate sequence (ie, drug before drug).
Pharmacokinetic data from these patients demonstrated a decrease in drug clearance of approximately 33% when drug was administered following drug.
Potential interactions between drug, a substrate of CYP3A4, and drug (drug, drug, drug, and drug), which are substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4, have not been evaluated in clinical trials.

drug: The concomitant administration of drug has no apparent effect on the extent of absorption of drug.
drug: When drug is administered with drug, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free drug is not altered.
however, as with other drug, concomitant administration of drug and drug is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate drug, like other drug, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of drug, drug, drug, and increased toxicity.
Patients receiving these drugs who are given drug, or any other drug, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs.
drug: Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with drug or drug.

Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of drug with drug.
drug, as with other drug, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with drug, drug, or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of drug on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered drug (e.g., drug, drug) by patients receiving drug has not been completely evaluated.
In two combined 12-week placebo controlled trials that included drug doses of 15 mcg twice daily, 25 mcg twice daily, and 50 mcg once daily, 54 of 873 drug -treated subjects received concomitant drug at study entry.

Based on total drug concentrations, drug increased the AUC by 25% and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20% and 35%, respectively.
Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with drug to extend the half-life of drug is not recommended.
In vitro studies indicate that drug does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of drug or drug and that drug is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.
Concomitant use with other drug-containing medicines (including drug) may cause too much drug in the blood or urine, which may increase the chance of side effects.
Using drug with drug (heart medicine) may cause hypercalcemia (too much drug in the blood), which could increase the chance of developing an irregular heartbeat.
On the basis of the metabolism of drug by cytochrome P450 3A4, drug, drug, drug, drug, grapefruit juice, and other inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 would be expected to lead to an increase in plasma drug concentrations.
Furthermore, drug, drug, drug, and other inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma drug concentrations.
Concomitant administration of drug capsules and drug resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of drug, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by drug.
Under similar conditions, drug concentrations were not affected by concomitant drug administration.
Concomitant administration of drug with drug capsules is not recommended.
If drug or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with drug or drug, lower plasma levels of drug may occur.

Potential for Other Drugs to Affect drug drug is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 enzymes.
Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, drug) could cause an increase in drug clearance and lower blood levels.
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, drug) or CYP2D6 (eg, drug, drug, or drug) can inhibit drug elimination and cause increased blood levels.
drug: Coadministration of drug (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of drug increased the AUC of drug and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.
When concomitant administration of drug with drug occurs, drug dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
drug: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of drug with drug (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of drug by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, drug, by 35%.
drug dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of drug with drug occurs.
Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as drug or drug, would be expected to have similar effects and, therefore, should be accompanied by similar dose reductions.
drug: Coadministration of drug (200 mg BID), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with drug (30 mg QD) resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both drug and its active metabolite, drug.
When drug is added to drug therapy, drug dose should be doubled.

Although there was a slight reduction in blood sugar concentrations during concomitant administration of drug and drug, there were no signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.
drug SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING drug AND ITS CONGENERS.
SINCE THE CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF THESE TWO DRUGS CAN LEAD TO drug INTOXICATION, PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING drug TO A PATIENT ON drug THERAPY, A BASELINE drug SERUM LEVEL SHOULD BE OBTAINED.

drug does not alter drug protein binding.
In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of drug (300 m g/mL), the binding of drug was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound drug plasma levels.
Therapeutic concentrations of drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug andtolbutamide did not alter drug protein binding.
In a study involving 12 adult volunteers, TORADOLORAL was coadministered with a single dose of 25 mg drug, causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drug.
In another study, TORADOLIV/IM was given with two doses of 5000 U of drug to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template bleeding time of 6.4 minutes (3.2 to 11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes (3.4 to 7.5 min) for drug alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5 to 8.5 min) for placebo.
Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between drug and drug or drug, the administration of drug to patients taking drug should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored.
drug: drug IV/IM reduced the drug response to drug in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20% (mean sodium and urinary output decreased 17%).
drug: Concomitant administration of drug ORAL and drug resulted in decreased clearance of drug and significant increases in drug plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 m g/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours.
Therefore, concomitant use of drug and drug is contraindicated.

No significant drug interactions have been reported in studies of drug given with other drugs such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and oral drug in healthy volunteers, or given with drug to patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III).
drug Reversible increases in serum drug concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of drug with drug, and with some drug.
An increase in serum drug concentration has been reported during concomitant administration of drug with drug, so careful monitoring of serum drug levels is recommended during concomitant use.
Since drug is an drug, it may have a strong affinity for anions other than the bile acids.
Repeated doses of drug given prior to a single dose of drug in human trials have been reported to decrease drug absorption.
However, in a follow-up study in normal subjects, single-dose administration of drug and drug and twice-a-day administration for 5 days of both agents did not affect the extent of drug absorption, but had a small yet statistically significant effect on its rate of absorption;
Therefore, patients on drug should be observed when drug Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
Studies in humans show that the absorption of drug as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before drug.
The absorption of drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with drug;
No depressant effect on blood levels in humans was noted when drug was administered with any of the following drugs: drug, drug, drug, drug, drug (drug), drug, drug or drug.

Initial doses of drug, such as drug or drug, should be reduced and titrated to achieve the desired response.
drug: Co-administration of drug and drug was not associated with serotonin syndrome in Phase 1, 2 or 3 studies.
Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome associated with co-administration of drug and drug, including drug such as drug (drug), have been reported.
Patients who are treated with drug and concomitant drug should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, hyperpyrexia, hyperreflexia, incoordination).
If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (drug or concomitant drug).
drug: The effect of an drug- and drug-containing drug (drug)* on the pharmacokinetics of drug was investigated in 12 cancer patients.
There was a small increase in plasma concentrations of drug and one metabolite (drug);
there was no effect on the 3 major metabolites (drug, drug and drug).

Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly drug and drug.
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of drug reportedly are increased by chronic administration of high doses of drug.
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving drug even though drug has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs.
drug treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of drug.
drug or drug excess may decrease the effect of drug, and an drug deficiency can increase the effect of drug.
Serum concentration of drug and drug may increase when patients take drug.
drug may decrease thyroidal uptake of drug, a rebound in uptake may occur up to 5 days after sudden withdrawal of drug.
drug is metabolized to drug by cytochrome CYP 3A4.
Because CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of drug, patients already on CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as drug (e.g.
drug), drug (e.g. drug), and drug (e.g. drug, drug and drug) should have their dose of drug or drug adjusted.
Based on anecdotal reports, there may be an interaction between drug and drug.
There have been a number of reports in the post-marketing experience of coma and death associated with the concomitant intravenous misuse of drug and drug by addicts.
In many of these cases, drug was misused by self-injection of crushed drug tablets.

Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of drug while under treatment with drug or drug.
The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by drug and drug appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy or surgery, because drug is eliminated by multiple routes.
Blood levels of drug increased 24% when drug was coadministered with drug (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of drug (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.

drug may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given drug.
In order to avoid drug intoxication, drug plasma levels should be monitored closely.
If drug is given concomitantly with drug, the drug dose should be reduced (by approx. 50%), because drug amplifies the therapeutic actions and side-effects of drug massively.
Avoid the concomitant use of drug and drug (drug).
Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if drug is given with drug or drug.
Exert particular caution in combining drug with other drug (drug and drug): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.

Increasing the drug dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate drug Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL.
Corresponding values for free drug Cmin concentrations were 7 3, 9 4, and 11 6 micrograms/mL for 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day drug , respectively.
The ratios of the AUCs of unbound drug to the AUCs of the total drug were 11.1 %, 13.0%, and 11.5%, with coadministration of 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day of drug , respectively.
drug: Coadministration of drug with drug causes an increase in drug plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting drug, the steady-state trough (Cmin) drug concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
Effects of Other drug on drug  drug: drug causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of drug  (drug) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of drug causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of drug  as compared to the same dose of drug  given as monotherapy.
drug: drug causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of drug  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of drug results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of drug  as compared to the same dose of drug  given as monotherapy.
drug: Available data suggest that there is no significant effect of drug on the clearance of drug  at steady state, Therefore, the addition of drug is not expected to cause a clinically important effect on drug  (drug) plasma concentrations.
drug: It appears that drug may reduce plasma drug concentrations.
Steady-state plasma drug concentrations were found to be 29% lower than the mean concentrations of a group of newly diagnosed subjects with epilepsy also receiving 2400 mg of drug a day.
Effects of drug on drug  The rate and extent of absorption of a 2400 mg dose of drug  as monotherapy given as tablets was not affected when coadministered with drug.
Effects of drug on drug  The coadministration of drug (1000 mg/day) for 10 days did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax, Cmin, AUC, CI/kg or tmax at drug daily doses of 3000 or 3600 mg/day in 10 otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy.
Effects of drug  on Low-Dose drug A group of 24 nonsmoking, healthy white female volunteers established on an oral drug regimen containing 30 mg drug and 75 mg drug for at least 3 months received 2400 mg/day of drug from midcycle (day 15) to midcycle (day 14) of two consecutive oral drug cycles.
drug treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the drug AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug.
drug   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local drug or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
In vitro studies indicate CYP3A4 isoform and CYP1A2 isoform mediate the metabolism of drug to drug and drug, respectively.
Thus agents likely to be concomitantly administered with drug that are metabolized by this isoenzyme family may potentially interact with drug.
Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of drug may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as drug, drug, drug), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., drug;
drug e.g., drug;
and drug e.g., drug), CYP1A2 inducers (drug) and CYP1A2 inhibitors (drug and drug).
Dosage adjustment may be warranted when drug is concurrently administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP1A2 inhibitors as systemic drug levels may rise resulting in toxicity.
The possibility of increased interaction should be kept in mind when drug doses greater than 50 mg as a single dose or 200 mg of drug per day are used concomitantly with highly bound drugs.
drug: Concomitant administration of drug and drug does not interfere with the rate or extent of the absorption of drug administered as drug.
drug: drug does not alter drug absorption;
however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of drug decreased drug protein binding and increased drug plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without drug to 0.11 L/kg/h with drug.

drug (drug) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of drug.
The hypoglycemic action of drug may be potentiated by certain drugs including drug and other drugs that are highly protein bound, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
These drugs include the drug and other drug, drug, drug, thyroid products, drug, oral drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.

Because of its lack of anti-platelet effect drug is not a substitute for drug for cardiovascular prophylaxis.
In a parallel group drug interaction study comparing the intravenous prodrug form of drug at 40 mg BID (n=10) vs placebo (n=9), drug had no effect on in vitro drug-mediated inhibition of arachidonate- or collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.
drug: drug BID did not show a significant effect on the plasma exposure or renal clearance of drug.

drug did not have a statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug (a CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19 substrate).
drug: drug is primarily metabolized by CYP 2D6 and to a lesser extent by 3A4.
Coadministration with drug (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in drug plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, drug is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.
Even so drug plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of drug were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.
drug: drug 40 mg BID for 7 days produced significant decreases in drug serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%) with a 34% higher serum exposure compared to drug alone.
drug serum concentrations should be monitored closely when initiating or changing therapy with drug in patients receiving drug.
drug (450 mg BID for 7 days) had no effect on drug pharmacokinetics.

Because changes in glucose concentrations with drug coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for drug (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with drug coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.
Coadministration of drug with doses higher than 40 mg drug (e.g., 40 mg BID) have not been studied.
drug: drug is a CYP 3A4 substrate and CYP 2C19 substrate and inhibitor.
drug steady state plasma concentrations (40 mg BID) were not affected significantly with multiple doses of drug (40 mg QD).

These increased exposures of drug and drug should be taken into consideration when selecting an oral drug for women taking drug.
drug: drug (drug) is a CYP 3A4 and CYP 2C19 substrate.
Plasma exposure of drug (10 mg BID) was increased by 28% following administration of drug (40 mg BID) for 12 days, while plasma exposure of drug (40 mg BID) was not substantially increased following administration of drug (10 mg BID) for 12 days.
Although the magnitude of changes in drug plasma exposure when coadministered with drug were not sufficient to warrant dosage adjustments, patients may experience enhanced sedative side effects caused by increased exposure of drug under this circumstance.

After 14 days of co-administration, mean trough concentrations of drug and its metabolites, drug and drug, were elevated with drug by about three-fold compared to baseline concentrations.
drug produced only minor changes in the levels of drug and its metabolites.
However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of drug and metabolite concentrations when drug was taken with drug, drug, and drug.
Therefore, such combined treatment should be approached with caution and patients should be monitored closely when drug is combined with these drugs, particularly with drug.
Such individuals are referred to as poor metabolizers of drugs such as drug, drug, the drug, and drug.
In addition, certain drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including many drug (drug, drug, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isozyme, and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system, leading to drug interaction.
Concomitant use of drug with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either drug or the other drug.

Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a drug, including drug, with multivalent cation-containing products such as drug or drug drug, drug, drug chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing drug, drug, or drug may substantially decrease the absorption of drug, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
This time window is different than for other oral formulations of drug, which are usually administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after drug.
drug (but not drug): These drugs in combination with very high doses of drug have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies.
drug: The rate and extent of absorption of drug was bioequivalent when drug was given alone or when drug was given 2 hours after drug at the dose that maximally suppresses gastric acid secretion.

Interactions with Other CNS Agents: Concurrent use of drug with all drug (eg, drug, drug, drug, other drug, general drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug and drug) may result in additive central nervous system depressant effects.
Although no interaction between drug and drug has been observed, it is not recommended for use with drug.
Most cases of serious or fatal adverse events involving drug reported to the manufacturer or the FDA have involved either the administration of large initial doses or too frequent doses of the drug to nonopioid tolerant patients, or the simultaneous administration of drug with other drugs affecting respiration.
Interactions with drug: drug (eg, drug, drug, drug, drug and drug) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a drug such as drug.
In drug-dependent patients, drug may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
Effect of drug on other drugs: Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6): drug  is a strong in vitro inhibitor of CYP2D6.
Therefore, dose adjustments of concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., drug, drug, drug and most drug) may be required.
drug: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg drug with 50 mg drug increased drug exposure and drug (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
Effect of other drugs on drug : drug  is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2.
drug: drug is metabolized in part by CYP3A4.
Co-administration of drug, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased drug exposure following a single 90 mg dose of drug by 2.3 fold.

Results from human in vitro metabolism studies and nonclinical studies show that drug  (drug) is neither metabolized by nor inhibits or induces the cytochrome P450 pathway suggesting that drug is not likely to cause or be subject to P450-based metabolic drug interactions in man.
Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of drug had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of drug and drug.
Co-administration of single 25-mg dose drug had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of total drug.

drug: The influence of the bile-acidsequestering agent drug on the pharmacokinetits of drug was evaluated in 12 healthy males in 2 separate randomized crossover studies.
In the first study, concomitant administration of 0.2 mg drug and 12 g drug resulted in decreases of more than 22% for AUC and 40% for Cmax when compared to dosing drug alone.
However, in the second study, administration of 12 g drug 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg drug approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the drug AUC of less than 8%, and a decrease in Cmax of about 30% when compared to dosing drug alone.
Therefore, it would be expected that a dosing schedule of drug given at bedtime and drug given before the evening meal would not result in a significant decrease in the clinical effect of drug.

Since drug and drug, including drug, may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels, the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.
- Drugs with ototoxic potential: Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered drug in patients to whom drug are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.
- drug: drug should generally not be given with drug (such as drug) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of drug toxicity.
- drug: Pretreatment with drug reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by drug.
This antagonistic effect of drug on drug natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of drug.
Thus, drug should not be administered concurrently with drug.
- drug: drug blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during drug treatment and inhibits the drug-induced increase in plasma renin activity.
- drug: drug may potentiate the effect of various drug, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.

Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without drug replacement, may alter the pharmacokinetics of certain concomitant medications, such as drug and drug.
drug containing drug, when administered concomitantly with drug, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption.
The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of drug onto the surface of drug.
drug, such as drug and drug, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of drug.
The resulting increase in drug serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract drug.
Therefore, interactions could occur following concomitant administration of drug (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug).
Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., drug, drug), myelotoxic (e.g., drug chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., drug) or hepatotoxic (e.g., drug, drug) effects with drug may increase toxicity in these organ systems.

Concomitant administration of drug with drug resulted in a 45% increase in systemic exposure to drug.
drug had no significant effect on the anticoagulant effect of drug in healthy subjects on stable drug therapy.
However, because some drug have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of drug or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a drug is administered concomitantly with drug or its derivatives.
The absorption of oral drug is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an drug containing drug and drug.

Although drug used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with drug and drug may occur.
Close observation of the patient is recommended when a drug is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as drug, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.
Patients receiving drug along with either oral or intravenous drug should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension.
The concomitant use of drug with drug and drugs may have additive effects on prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.
drug and drug may have additive hypotensite effects due to the inhibition of each other s metabolism.
In patients receiving a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as drug or drug, a dose increase to 500 mg daily should be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction, and clinical response and adverse events should be carefully monitored (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics-Drug-Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-Dosage Adjustment sections).
International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients taking drug while on drug therapy.
Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, drug and drug) decrease drug metabolism and increase drug plasma concentrations.
Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (drug such as drug or drug) may reduce plasma concentrations of drug and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.

drug such as drug or drug;
Oral drug: drug appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.
Patients stabilized on oral drug who are found to require drug replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
drug or Oral drug: Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in drug or oral drug requirements.
Patients receiving drug or oral drug should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy.
drug: drug binds both drug and drug in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these drug.
Therefore, 4 to 5 hours should elapse between administration of drug and drug.
drug, Oral drug: drug tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg).
In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free drug may be decreased when drug are started thus increasing drug requirements.

drug) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other drug, drug, and the drug drug and drug).
While all the drug (drug), e.g., drug, drug, drug, and drug, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.
drug has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in drugmetabolism.
The extent to which drug-druginteractions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug involved.
Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of drug with any of the drug and also in switching from one class to the other.
Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating drugtreatment in a patient being withdrawn from drug, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).
Concomitant use of agents in the drug (which includes drug) with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug or the other drug.
It is desirable to monitor drugplasma levels whenever an agent of the drug including drug is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 (and/or P450 1A2).
Because drug is highly bound to serum protein, the administration of drug to patients taking other drugs that are highly bound to protein (e.g., drug, drug) may cause an increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
drug toxicity may be aggravated by the initial release of norepinephrine caused by drug Injection.
The pressor effects of drug such as drug or drug are enhanced by drug.
Although there is little published information on concomitant administration of drug and drug, these drugs are often administered concurrently without any evidence of interactions resulting in adverse effects or diminished efficacy.
drug potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all drug, most notably drug, and MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) is reduced by concomitant administration of N 2O.
drug may decrease the effectiveness of oral drug, certain drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug.
Because drug is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), inhibition of this enzyme prolongs and potentiates the effect of drug.
Patients who have been treated with drug within two to three weeks prior to the administration of drug should receive initial doses of drug no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose.
Concurrent administration of low-dose drug and drug may produce an additive or potentiating effect on urine flow.
Cardiac effects of drug are antagonized by drug, such as drug and drug.

The results of a study of coadministration of drug (50 mg/kg) with an drug containing drug to 13 patients with tuberculosis showed a reduction of mean serum concentrations and urinary excretion of drug of approximately 20% and 13%, respectively, suggesting that the oral absorption of drug may be reduced by these drug.
It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of drug with drug containing drug for at least 4 hours following drug administration.
Drug Interactions: The central drug syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as drug are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain drug such as drug, the drug and other drug, drug, certain drug such as the drug salts, and drug.
Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System drug is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when drug  is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.
The concomitant use of transdermal drug with drug or other potent 3A4 inhibitors such as drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and nefazadone may result in an increase in drug plasma concentrations.
The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as drug and drug with transdermal drug may also result in an increase in drug plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
drug: The concomitant use of drug  (drug transdermal system) with other drug, including but not limited to other drug, drug, drug, drug (e.g., drug), general drug, drug, drug, and drug, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
drug: drug  is not recommended for use in patients who have received drug within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by drug has been reported with drug
In vitro studies have shown drug can displace drugs, such as drug, from their protein-binding sites.
It is recommended that if drug is started in patients already receiving drug, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the drug dose may be necessary.

drug antagonize the effects of drug.
drug may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of drug;
drug may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as drug.
Because drug may interfere with the absorption of drug, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
However, it was observed that the pharmacokinetics of drug  was unaltered by concomitant drug in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent drug  and drug therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with drug  alone (0%).
Two percent of patients treated concurrently with drug  and drug developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L).
Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with drug, to which drug was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either drug CI or drug alone.
Caution should be exercised when administering drug with drug since interactions have been seen with other drug.
Concomitant administration of an drug-containing drug had no significant effect in the bioavailability of drug.
drug (drug- or drug-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg drug capsules with 30 mL drug suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
There are no significant effects on drug pharmacokinetics if the drug is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after drug.
If drug are required during drug therapy, drug should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the drug.
drug: As with other drug, drug inhibits the renal excretion of drug, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak drug plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
drug and Foods Fortified With drug Concomitant administration of drug with a therapeutic drug containing 60 mg of elemental drug (as FeSO4) or drug supplemented with 10 mg of elemental drug reduced extent of absorption by 80% and 31%, respectively.
If drug are required during drug therapy, drug should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.
The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental drug (primarily drug-fortified breakfast cereals) on drug absorption has not been studied.
Concomitantly administered drug-fortified infant formula (2.2 mg elemental drug/6 oz) has no significant effect on drug pharmacokinetics.
Therefore, drug for Oral Suspension can be administered with drug-fortified infant formula.
The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between drug or its breakdown products and drug in the gastrointestinal tract.
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using drug, but not with those using drug.
Concurrent use of drug with drug (e.g., drug, drug, drug, and drug) may result in increased drug effects.
When used concurrently with such drugs, the dose of drug should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduced as much as possible when administered concomitantly with drugs that potentiate the action of drug.
In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a 1-mg dose of drug administered as drug were not affected by the coadministration of a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of drug.
However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of drug were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in Cmax) when a 1-mg dose of drug was administered 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of drug nasal spray.
When the drug was administered 30 minutes after the drug nasal spray, the AUC of drug increased 11% and Cmax decreased 18%.
In neither case were the pharmacokinetics of drug affected by coadministration with drug.
These results suggest that the analgesic effect of drug may be diminished when it is administered shortly after drug nasal spray, but by 30 minutes any such reduction in effect should be minimal.
The safety of using drug and drug (drug) Nasal Spray during the same episode of migraine has not been established.
The pharmacokinetics of a 1-mg dose of drug administered as drug were not affected by the coadministration of drug (300 mg QID).
Conversely, the administration of drug (1 mg drug QID) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a 300-mg dose of drug.
It is not known if the effects of drug are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (drug, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed.
The fraction of drug absorbed is unaffected by the concomitant administration of a drug (drug), but the rate of absorption is decreased.
Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if drug is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a drug.
No information is available about the use of drug concurrently with drug.
Hypotension: Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on drug and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug or drug.

drug requirements (i.e., drug) may be altered.
conversely, drug may interfere with drug (i.e., drug, drug).
Concurrent use of drug may antagonize the anorectic effect of drug.
Drugs that may increase drug plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors: drug is a CYP3A4 substrate.

Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another drug and drug but may be seen after several months.
For these reasons, it is felt that, in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the possible benefits of combined therapy with drug and a drug do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.
While it is not known whether this interaction occurs with drug other than drug, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occasionally been associated with the use of drug alone, including drug.
Therefore, the combined use of drug with drug should generally be avoided.
Treatment with drug once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy subjects was associated with an inhibition of P450 1A2 and a 25% increase in drug AUC.

drug should be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance  50 mL/min and drug should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance  50 mL/min
The adverse effects of drug, such as myelosuppression and diarrhea, would be expected to be exacerbated by other drug having similar adverse effects.
Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving drug, and it is possible that the administration of drug as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect.
The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater (8.5%, 4/47 patients) when drug was administered on the same day as drug than when these drugs were given on separate days (1.3%, 1/80 patients).
It would be expected that drug use during therapy with drug would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied.
In view of the potential risk of dehydration secondary to vomiting and/or diarrhea induced by drug, the physician may wish to withhold drug during dosing with drug and, certainly, during periods of active vomiting or diarrhea.

drug/drug: drug inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of drug and drug to drug.
In patients receiving drug (drug) or drug (drug), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of drug per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of drug or drug.
Subsequent adjustment of doses of drug or drug should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects.
drug: It has been reported that drug prolongs the half-life of the drug, drug.
The clinical basis of this drug interaction has not been established but should be noted when drug is given to patients already on drug therapy.
drug: Since the excretion of drug is similar to that of urate, drug, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of drug and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
The concomitant administration of drug and drug has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with drug alone.
Although clinical evidence to date has not demonstrated renal precipitation of oxypurines in patients either on drug alone or in combination with drug, the possibility should be kept in mind.
drug: The reports that the concomitant use of drug and drug may contribute to the enhancement of drug toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on drug and drug even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..

drug: drug: drug, when given as a regimen of 125mg with drug coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and drug when given as 80 mg/day with drug coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of drug, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
The oral drug doses should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with drug, to achieve exposures of drug similar to those obtained when it is given without drug.
The daily dose of drug administered in clinical studies with drug reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of drug.
drug, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of drug, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when drug was coadministered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3.

drug: A single 125-mg dose of drug was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilized on chronic drug therapy.
Although there was no effect of drug on the plasma AUC of drug or drug determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in drug (a CYP2C9 substrate) trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with drug.
In patients on chronic drug therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be closely monitored in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of the 3-day regimen of drug with each chemotherapy cycle.
drug: drug, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of drug (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of drug 500 mg was admini,stered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of drug and on Days 4,8, and 15.
Oral drug: drug, when given once daily for 14 days as a 100-mg capsule with an oral drug containing 35 mcg of drug and 1 mg of drug, decreased the AUC of drug by 43%, and decreased the AUC of drug by 8%;

drug: drug increased the AUC of drug, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, by 2.3-fold on Day 1 and 3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of drug 2 mg was coadministered on Day 1 and Day 5 of a regimen of drug 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 through 5.
The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of drug or other drug metabolized via CYP3A4 (drug, drug) should be considered when coadministering these agents with drug.
In another study with intravenous administration of drug, drug was given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, and drug 2 mg IV was given prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of drug and on Days 4, 8, and 15.
drug increased the AUC of drug by 25% on Day 4 and decreased the AUC of drug by 19% on Day 8 relative to the dosing of drug on Days 1 through 3.
therefore, coadministration of drug with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may result in increased plasma concentrations of drug.
Consequently, concomitant administration of drug with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug) should be approached with caution.
Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., drug) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of drug, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.
therefore, coadministration of drug with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity (e.g., drug, drug, drug) may result in reduced plasma concentrations of drug that may result in decreased efficacy of drug.

drug: When a single 375-mg dose of drug was administered on Day9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of drug, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of drug decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold.
Coadministration of drug with drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may result in reduced plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of drug.
drug: In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of drug once daily, as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation, with drug 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2-fold increase of drug AUC and a simultaneous 1.7-fold increase of drug AUC.
drug: Coadministration of once daily doses of drug, as a tablet formulation comparable to 85 mg or 170 mg of the capsule formulation, with drug 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and Cmax, by approximately 20% of both drug and drug.

Because drug is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, drug should not be used concomitantly with a drug.
At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a drug and initiation of treatment with drug.
At least 3 weeks should elapse between discontinuation of drug and initiation of treatment with a drug.
A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of drug (drug) and agents for migraine therapy, such as drug (drug) and drug.
drug should not be administered with other drug.
drug decreases drug clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.
drug, and the drug drug (drug) and drug (drug) have all been used with drug.
drug increases the clearance of drug by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
Since the pharmacokinetics of drug were studied in patients treated with drug, the clearance of drug at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with drug.
Because drug is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of drug prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with drug may result in reduced drug clearance based upon the known property of drug to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
drug has been found to temporarily raise serum concentrations of drug.
drug may potentiate the adverse effects of other drug administered concomitantly.
In particular, convulsions have been reported when drug is administered with drug and special care should be taken when the treatment regimen includes both of these drugs.

drug: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of drug particularly with higher doses of drug (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
drug or drug: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either drug or drug is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the drug (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
drugs: In a small clinical trial in which drug was administered to drug treated patients, no effect on prothrombin time was detected.
However, another drug has been found to produce a less than two-second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of drug.
Also, bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time have been reported in a few patients taking drugs concomitantly with drug.
It is recommended that in patients taking drug, prothrombin time be determined before starting drug and frequently enough during early therapy to insure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs.
drug therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking drug.
drug: In normal volunteers, there was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with concomitant administration of single doses of drug and drug.
drug: In patients with hypercholesterolemia, concomitant administration of drug and drug resulted in no effect on drug plasma concentrations.
Oral drug: In pharmacokinetic studies of drug in hypercholesterolemic noninsulin dependent diabetic patients, there was no drug interaction with drug or with drug
May interact with addictive medications, especially drug with habituating potential (prolonged concurrent use may increase the risk of habituation), drug or CNS depression producing medications (concurrent use may increase the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug).
